que1: what is javascript?
ans:
   1]javascript is a scripting language that allows you to implement complex features on web page.
   2]javascript is a single threaded synchronous language.
   3] single threaded, that means one code will be executed at a time.
   4] javascript is a interpreted language.that means ,where our code is going to line by line.
   5] javascript code is executing line by line.
   synchronous:--------> after executing the first line it will be forwarded to next line.

   =======================================================================================

   que2: what is the javascript run time environment?
   ans:
      1]The JavaScript runtime environment provides access to built-in libraries and objects that are available to a program.
      so that it can interact with the outside world and make the code work.
      2]In the context of a browser comprised of:
      The JavaScript engine (which in turn is made up of the heap and the call stack)
      Web APIs------------->
      1.The callback queue
      2.The event loop

    ======================================================================================

    que3: what is execution context?
    ans:
       1]The  browser js engine that creates a special environment to handle the execution of js code.
       2]In execution context ,contains the code thats currently running.
       3]During execution context, run time the spcification code gets parse by a parser, the variables and functions are stored in memory.and executable byte code gets generated and the code will be executed.
       4]There are two types of execution context:
       1.Global execution context
       2.Functional execution context

    ======================================================================================

    que4:what is javascript Engine?
    ans:
       1] The JavaScript Engine is a program whose responsibility is to execute JavaScript code.
       2]All modern browsers come with their own version of the JavaScript Engine but the most popular one is Googles V8 Engine.
       V8 -> Open-source JavaScript Engine developed by Google for Chrome.

    ======================================================================================

    que5:flow of data in engine?
    ans:
       1]The environment needs to have an engine, which takes the JS code that's written in human-readable syntax and turns it into machine code.
       2]The engine uses a parser to go through the code line by line and check if the syntax is correct. If there are any errors, code will stop executing and an error will be thrown.

       Parsers:-A Parser or Syntax Parser is a program that reads your code line-by-line. 
       It understands how the code fits the syntax defined.     
       AST:-a tree representation of the source code of a computer program that conveys the structure 
       of the source code.
       compilation:- It will converted code into machine level language.
       Execution:-Execution context allows the JavaScript engine to manage the complexity of interpreting and running our code.
